# IPEDS Data Analysis

## Getting Started

Download everything in Box. You should then able to run `ipeds_cleaned.R` and `ipeds_analysis.R`. It is not necessary to run `ipeds_cleaned.R` since that is used for generating `degrees_by_year.csv` and the file is already provided in Box. However, if you want to make changes to the file generated, you can make changes in `ipeds_cleaned.R`. `ipeds_analysis.R` is used for joining national and institutional level data together for analysis and generating plots.

Below is a more in depth explanation of all the files in Box.

## Folders

**`datasets`** : Yearly IPEDS data on degrees awarded at institutions from 2010 to 2023. Each year's data is stored in a folder labeled in the format "C20YY_A". C20YY_A usually contains two files: "c20yy_a.csv" and "c20yy_a_rv.csv", where the filename containing "rv" is the revised file.

-   Note: 2023 doesn't have a folder yet because the revised dataset has not been published yet (as of June 2025).

**`dictionaries`** : a select few dictionaries for files in `datasets`.

-   Note: does not contain all dictionaries since the variables remain the same throughout the years

**`info_files`**:

-   `CCIHE2021-CIPMAP.xlsx` is a map of CIP codes to disciplinary domains based on [Carnegie classificiations](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/carnegie-classification/){.uri}

-   `Crosswalk2010_2020.csv` lists all CIP codes that were removed, replaced, added, or otherwise revised from the [2010 to 2020 classifications](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/resources.aspx?y=56) of instructional programs

-   `hd2022.csv` contains directory information for institutions in the 2022-23 school year, and institutional characteristics for 2022-23 school year

    -   `hd2022.xlsx` contains documentation for the .csv file

-   `CIPCode2010.csv` and `CipCode2020.csv` contain CIP code titles, descriptions, cross references and examples for 2010 and 2020 CIP codes, respectively.

-   `IC2022`

    -   `ic2022.csv` contains institutional characteristics (program offerings, affiliation, control) for institutions in the 2022-23 school year.

        -   `ic2022_rv.csv` is the revised version of this file

    -   `ic2022.xlsx` contains documentation for the .csv file

**`plots`** contains jpeg and png files of plots generated by `ipeds_analysis.R` . See [Plots generated by ipeds_analysis.R]

## `ipeds_cleaned.R`

Contains all the code for joining the yearly IPEDS data together and filtering out religious and for-profit institutions. `degrees_by_year.csv` is produced at the end of the script.

## `ipeds_analysis.R`

Contains code for creating tibbles for analysis of institutions over the years.

-   `degrees_by_year_short.csv` has 1 row for every 4-digit CIP code an institution offers per year

    -   `degrees_by_year_long.csv` has 1 row per institution; each observation contains the number of degrees awarded for a 4-digit CIP code for an institution from 2010-2023
